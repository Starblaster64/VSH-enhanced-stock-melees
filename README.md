# [VSH] Enhanced Stock Melees
Adds minor bonuses to the stock melee weapons in VSH to make them not completely useless. Also allows reskins of stock melee weapons to recieve the same enhancements by way of a CVAR.

Currently enhances the stock melee weapons of:
* Scout
* Soldier
* Demoman
* Heavy
* Engineer

## Development
Currently stable and should be error free. Still brainstorming ideas for the other 3 classes (Spy's melee doesn't need enhancement).

## Credits
Several stocks and other code snippets were taken from the main VSH plugin. All credit for those snippets and stocks go to their respective owners.

## Dependencies
Requires the following includes to compile:
* TF2Attributes
* SaxtonHale
* Morecolors

Requires the following plugins to run on a server:
* TF2Attributes
* SaxtonHale (duh)
  * By extension; SaxtonHale dependencies
